# Iris Data Exploration

This repository contains a concise exploration of the classic Iris dataset using Python and Pandas. The analysis demonstrates basic data inspection, summary statistics, and notes about the dataset structure to help with reproducible, beginner-friendly data work.

## Files

- `iris_data_exploration.ipynb` — a Jupyter Notebook with data loading, inspection, and summary statistics.
- `iris.csv` — the dataset (sepal/petal measurements and species labels).

## Quickstart

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install minimal dependencies:

```powershell
pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

3. Launch the notebook:

```powershell
jupyter notebook iris_data_exploration.ipynb
```

## Notebook overview

- Loads `iris.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame.
- Shows the first rows, data types, and dataset shape.
- Provides a short, professional description of rows and columns and explains why data types matter.

## Notes

- The notebook is intended for learning and quick EDA (exploratory data analysis). It is kept minimal and well-documented so you can extend it with visualizations or modeling workflows.

If you'd like, I can add example visualizations (scatter plots, pairplots) or a short ML demo (simple classifier). Which would you prefer next?
